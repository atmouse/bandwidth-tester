so, there are 2 ways to 'max out' the bandwidth:

- create more threads
- have a single thread spam lots

with dccp, we cant have a single thread spam lots, and the time granularity is too small to increase the bandwidth -> we need to make more threads.

what about tcp? how do we approach that in terms of threads? udp?. 

right
